# check_ups plugins

Suite of plugins for monitoring UPSs supporting SNPM and RFC1628 (UPS-MIB). Specifically, the suite is composed by:

* `check_ups_alarms`: Checks the active UPS alarms.
* `check_ups_battery_values`: Checks the UPS battery values (voltage, current and temperature).
* `check_ups_inputs`: Checks the UPS power input levels (voltage, current and power).
* `check_ups_mode`: Checks the UPS working mode (online, bypass or offline, with batteries normal, low or depleted).
* `check_ups_outputs`: Checks the UPS output levels (voltage, current, power and load percent).
