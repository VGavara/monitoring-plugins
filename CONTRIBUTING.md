# Contributing to the Monitoring Plugins library project

First of all, thanks for being reading this file! That means that in some way and in some degree you are considering contributing to this project. Though initially conceived as personal project, any community help if welcome.

The next section defines different scenarios of project contribution. It is a good first step if you have an idea of how to collaborate.

# Ways of collaboration

Below you'll find different ways of collaboration sorted by what I consider is more probable collaborations to less probable.

## I want to submit a bug
Most of the contents of this collection were developed years ago, so it's very possible that some of the packages used by the plugins had changed, as happened with the Perl package `Monitoring::Plugin` that, due to copyright issues, was renamed to `Monitoring::Plugin` package.

If you have found a bug the best way of communicating it is by creating a new discussion in the [Spooky Stuff](https://github.com/VGavara/monitoring-plugins/discussions/categories/spooky-stuff) category. Take your time to describe it in the best way: fixing a bug is not always easy, and the more information you provide the easier will be. Any kind of additional data (screenshots, videos, ...) will help, though they were not extrictly necessary.

## I want to suggest a new feature
So you have used the library and missed some feature that would be nice to have. In that case feel free of start a discussion in the [Ideas](https://github.com/VGavara/monitoring-plugins/discussions/categories/ideas) category. Those proposals considered as interesting will be converted into features. Finally they will be programmed to be published in a given release.

## I just have a question
Asking questions is also a way of collaboration: some questions are the inspiration of new features that for sure improve the library. If you have a question, just ask it in the Discussions [Questions & Answers](https://github.com/VGavara/ArduinoTB6612FNG/monitoring-plugins/categories/questions-answers) category.

## I want to work on a good first issue
Some existing issues are labelled as "good first issue", meaning that they are a good starting point for begin collaborating in the project. If you have identified such a issue, please contact the repository owner to discuss specific details of the issue before starting coding. In case you didn't have chosen an issue, again contact the repository owner for discussing what could be a your good first issue.

## I want to work on a given issue, no matter is a good first one
You're a brave programmer, no doubt. If you want to be helpful for the project, no matter how, the best way is contacting the repository owner to discuss the best available issue for you.

## I want to be involved in a different way
If you think that you can be valuable for this project in a different, not previously described way, feel free to contact with the repository owner (vgavara) in order to expose your idea.
